Platypus-API
=====================

This cross-platform mobile application will effortlessly assist with the task of deciding who will pay what when the bill arrives. After taking a photo of your bill OCR text recognition will create an interface that will be used to claim items and see the total amount you owe. The same interface will be duplicated on everyone around the table's phone and changes will be updated on the different phones in real time.

This is the repository for the API of the system. It is responsible for front-end functionality, data flow, storage and communication.

Please see the [Platypus-API Wiki](https://github.com/COS301-brute-force/Platypus-API/wiki) for detailed information and usage instructions.
